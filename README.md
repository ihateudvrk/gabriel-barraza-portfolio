# Gabriel-Barrazas-Portfolio

## A simple portfolio page made from HTML and CSS during the U of M bootcamp with EDX.
In the future I would love to expand on this portfolio and add more as I go. Things like a hambruger button utilizing javascript and so forth.

## Usage 
Simply open the page and click around. If everything is going well the different Nav bar items should take the user to the corresponding section of the website.
